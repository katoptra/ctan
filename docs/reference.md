# Reference

The verified numbers behind the mirror: what the tree measures, what the platforms allow,
what it costs, how it is watched, and what to do when a run fails. Every figure carries the
date it was verified. Re-verify before leaning on a stale one; the commands that produced
the measured figures are named beside them.

Conventions: GB is 10^9 bytes, GiB and MiB are binary. R2 publishes binary figures, CTAN
decimal. "Stored set" is every regular file `rsync -rL` yields, which is what `normalise`
keeps.

## 1. Baseline

Measured 2026-08-26 from a dereferenced dante listing (538,289 lines, 6.9 s wall clock,
50.7 MB).

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| Stored set | 511,027 objects, 139.63 GB (130.04 GiB) |
| Of which revision-stamped tlnet and tlcontrib containers | 15,133 objects, 7.09 GB, each the same bytes as its stable twin |
| Largest object | 6,865,013,189 B (`systems/mac/mactex/MacTeX.pkg`) |
| Longest key | 151 bytes |
| Distinct directories holding a file directly | 24,953 (24,952 plus the root) |
| Distinct directories, every one incl. file-less | 27,262: adds 2,309 that hold only subdirectories — what `render` draws a page for (2026-08-27) |
| Directory-page objects | 54,523: every directory's page under both keys, all but the root's, which has no slashless key |
| Churn, last 30 days | 16,574 files, 4.72 GB; 23.0 files per hour on average |
| Hour-slots with any change, last 30 days | 284 of 720 |
| Hour-slots over 1,000 files, last 30 days | 3 |
| Busiest hour by count, last 365 days | 5,950 files, 0.037 GB (2026-01-12 16h) |
| Busiest hour by bytes, last 365 days | 20.35 GB in 9 files (2026-03-01 09h, ISO copies) |
| Busiest hour by bytes, installers excluded | under 0.001 GB |
| Objects over R2's 4.995 GiB single-part limit | 5: two MacTeX pkgs at 6.87 GB, three ISOs at 6.78 GB |
| Objects over Cloudflare's 512 MB cacheable limit | 7: the five above plus two `protext` zips at 1.14 GB |
| Whole tree at `BATCH_GB=4` | 28 batches plus 5 lone oversize files = 33 rsync connections; largest batch 98,141 files |

The churn figure is a floor: a file changed twice in a month counts once, because it is
derived from current mtimes. Even at three times the measured rate it stays under 100k
PutObjects a month, well inside the free tier.

## 2. Limits

### R2

Source: [R2 limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/platform/limits/),
[S3 API compatibility](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/s3/api/),
[Multipart](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/objects/multipart-objects/). Verified
2026-08-26.

| Limit | Value | What the mirror asks | At the limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Objects, storage per bucket | unlimited | 511k, 140 GB | billing only |
| Object size | 5 TiB (4.995 TiB in practice) | 6.87 GB max | reject |
| Single-part upload | 4.995 GiB = 5,363,466,240 B | 5 objects exceed it, so go multipart | `EntityTooLarge`, run fails |
| Multipart parts | 10,000, each 5 MiB–5 GiB, uniform | 13 parts per 6.87 GB file at 512 MiB | reject |
| Incomplete multipart uploads | aborted after 7 days | at most one after a cut-off job | storage held up to 7 days |
| Key length | 1,024 bytes | 151 max | reject |
| Writes per key | 1 per second | one state write per batch, minutes apart | 429 |
| `ListObjectsV2` page | 1,000 keys | 497 pages per reconcile | — |
| `DeleteObjects` batch | 1,000 keys | one call in a typical hour | `MalformedXML` |
| Class A operations | 1M/month free, then $4.50/M | ~30 an hour | bill |
| Class B operations | 10M/month free, then $0.36/M | 1 a run plus user traffic | bill |
| Custom domains per bucket | 100 | 1 | — |

`aws.config` sets `multipart_threshold = 4GB`, which the AWS CLI reads as binary — 4 GiB,
safely under the 4.995 GiB single-part ceiling — and `multipart_chunksize = 512MB`, giving
13 uniform parts for the largest file.

### Cloudflare zone, Free plan

The zone is configured by hand and the pipeline never calls the Cloudflare API. Section 6
lists the rules the mirror wants and why.

| Limit | Value | What the mirror asks |
|---|---|---|
| Cache Rules | 10 | 1 |
| Transform Rules | 10, no regex on Free | 2 |
| Configuration Rules | 10 | 1 |
| Single Redirects | 10 | 0 |
| Cacheable object size | 512 MB | 7 objects over it, served from R2 every time |
| Upload through the zone | 100 MB | 0; uploads go to the S3 endpoint |

### GitHub Actions

| Limit | Value | What the mirror asks |
|---|---|---|
| Job time | 6 h, counted from the actual start | `timeout-minutes: 350` |
| Runner disk | 14 GB documented | the 1.2 GB toolbox image, plus at most one 4 GB batch and the 6.87 GB outlier |
| Runner RAM | 16 GB | under 300 MB |
| Concurrent jobs | 20 on Free | 1; `concurrency: sync` queues an overlapping slot |
| Job summary | 1 MiB per step, 20 steps | about 2 KB |
| Dispatch queueing | one pending run per `concurrency` group; the rest are dropped | a dispatch arriving during a run waits, and the next hour's delta subsumes any it displaced |

Log volume is undocumented and lines are silently dropped, which is why `report` counts from
`RUN/` and never from the log.

Nothing caches the toolbox image. Each job is a fresh VM, `docker build` writes to that VM's
own daemon store, and it dies with the job, so every run rebuilds from the pinned base: 28 s
measured 2026-08-28, against a job measured in minutes. Within a job the `image` task's
`status` guard means one build serves every `task run`. Caching it through the Actions cache
would buy back less than it costs to maintain.

### Docker Hub

Anonymous pulls are limited to 100 per hour per source IP (`ratelimit-limit: 100;w=3600`,
read from `registry-1.docker.io` on 2026-08-28). Each run pulls the pinned Ubuntu base once,
so the mirror wants 1 of the 100. The budget is per IP and GitHub's hosted runners share
egress addresses, so it is not the mirror's alone; a throttled or failed pull fails the run
at the build, before any of the pipeline has run.

### dante and CTAN

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| Sync frequency CTAN asks of a mirror | at least once an hour, at a fixed minute |
| mirmon freshness band | 28 h; past it the mirror is not redirected to |
| dante `max connections` | unpublished; the run opens at most 2 sequentially |
| Full listing | 6.9 s, 50.7 MB |
| rsync `MAXPATHLEN` | 1,024 bytes |
| rsync `--max-alloc` | about 1 GB per allocation; the file list is about 10 MB |

rsync exit codes the `retry` task treats as transient: 5, 10, 12, 30, 35. Exit 24 (a file
vanished mid-transfer) is a success — upstream moved under us and the next run picks it up.

### Tools

| Tool | Figure |
|---|---|
| AWS CLI retries | `retry_mode = standard`, `max_attempts = 10`; 20 s backoff cap |
| AWS CLI timeouts | connect 60 s, read 300 s as configured |
| AWS CLI `max_queue_size` | 1,000 tasks; the queue blocks rather than failing |
| `xz` memory | 100 MB at `-6`, 421 MB at `-9` |
| `sort` memory | 68 MB for 511k lines |
| `shasum -a 512` | about 650 MB/s, so about 7 s per 4 GB batch |
| `split` suffixes | `-a 4` is needed above 676 files |

### healthchecks.io

Hobbyist plan, $0: 20 checks, 100 log entries per check, 5 pings per minute per check, ping
body stored to 100 kB. The pipeline sends one ping per run, so the log holds roughly the
last four days.

## 3. Cost

Prices from [R2 pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/), verified
2026-08-26: storage $0.015/GB-month with 10 GB-month free, Class A $4.50/M with 1M free,
Class B $0.36/M with 10M free, egress free. `DeleteObject` and `AbortMultipartUpload` are
free. Cloudflare rounds usage up to the next billing unit, and the unit for operations is
one million — so any Class A overage at all costs $4.50.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Storage today | 139.8 GB-month (0.14 of it directory pages, each stored twice), minus 10 free, 129.8 × $0.015 = **$1.95/month** |
| At the 200 GB ceiling | 190 billable = $2.85/month |
| Class A per month | 30 reconcile listings + 1,440 state writes + churn + a few thousand directory pages ≈ 45k → $0; drawing every page once is 54.5k |
| Class B per month | 720 state reads + about 5,760 `smoke` reads ≈ 6.5k → $0 |
| One uncached `scheme-full` install | 11,919 GETs, 5.51 GB; free until 27 installs a day |
| Budget | $5/month; `plan` refuses a tree over `CEILING_GB` (200) before anything uploads |

Storage is the only line that is ever billed at this size. The design keeps Class A low by
never listing the bucket outside the daily reconcile: an hourly sync that listed the bucket
twice a run would cost $4.50/month at 200 GB.

Whether R2's storage meter counts GB as 10^9 or 2^30 is unverified; this file uses 10^9,
the larger bill. If it is binary the same bucket is 114 GB-month, $1.71.

### Traffic

Every figure above is what the pipeline itself spends. What readers spend is measured
2026-08-29 from [dotsrc.org's request logs](https://dotsrc.org/statistics/), which record
every HTTP request to `mirrors.dotsrc.org` by path and size and publish them as daily JSON:
its CTAN tree over five sampled days (2021-11-16, 2022-01-19, 2022-02-16, 2022-03-05,
2022-03-09).

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| One mid-tier mirror | 68,080 requests and 85 GB a day = 2.1M requests, 2.6 TB a month |
| Spread across the five days | 46,770–109,710 requests, 31.4–118.0 GB |
| Mean object served | 1.25 MB |
| CTAN-wide, across about 100 mirrors | roughly 150M requests and 200 TB a month |

The CTAN-wide line is an estimate, not a measurement: it puts dotsrc at 1.4% of the archive's
traffic and the primary nodes, which [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTAN) records
at over 6 TB a month, at 3% of its bytes. Read it to a factor of two.

Egress is free, so the bytes never bill and only the request count does — one Class B op per
GET, 10M free, then $0.36 per million rounded up. This bucket's bill against the share of all
CTAN traffic it might carry, with the cache bypassed as it is today:

| Share of CTAN | Requests/month | Requests/s | TB/month | Class B billed | Total/month |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1% | 1.5M | 0.6 | 2 | 0 | $1.95 |
| 3% | 4.5M | 1.7 | 6 | 0 | $1.95 |
| 5% | 7.5M | 2.9 | 10 | 0 | $1.95 |
| 8% | 12.0M | 4.6 | 16 | 2M | $2.67 |
| 10% | 15.0M | 5.7 | 20 | 5M | $3.75 |
| 15% | 22.5M | 8.6 | 30 | 13M | $6.63 |
| 20% | 30.0M | 11.4 | 40 | 20M | $9.15 |
| 50% | 75.0M | 28.5 | 100 | 65M | $25.35 |
| 75% | 112.5M | 42.8 | 150 | 103M | $39.03 |
| 100% | 150.0M | 57.1 | 200 | 140M | $52.35 |

A mirror in `mirror.ctan.org`'s rotation is the 1% row and change. The free tier runs out at
10M requests a month, 6.7% of the archive and five times what dotsrc carries; past it the rate
is flat. Serving every request CTAN receives, 200 TB of them, costs $52 a month, all but $1.95
of it operations. The same 200 TB of egress from S3 would be about $18,000.

### Caching

The zone bypasses cache (section 6). Cache storage and purges are free, so the only saving is
Class B ops avoided and the only question is the hit ratio. Modelled 2026-08-29 over the
511,027-object tree: Zipf popularity, ten origin-facing caches — Cloudflare caches per
datacentre, and Tiered Cache, free on every plan, fronts the origin with an upper tier per
region — and Poisson arrivals per object per cache per TTL window, where a window holding at
least one request costs exactly one fill. Central case α=0.9 with ten caches; the band spans
α=0.7 with thirty to α=1.1 with ten.

| Share | Bypass | 24 h TTL | 48 h TTL | 1 week TTL |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1% | $1.95 | $1.95 (36% hit) | $1.95 (40%) | $1.95 (49%) |
| 5% | $1.95 | $1.95 (47%) | $1.95 (52%) | $1.95 (62%) |
| 10% | $3.75 | $1.95 (52%) | $1.95 (57%) | $1.95 (68%) |
| 20% | $9.15 | $3.03 (57%) | $2.67 (63%) | $1.95 (74%) |
| 50% | $25.35 | $8.07 (65%) | $6.27 (71%) | $3.39 (83%) |
| 100% | $52.35 | $14.19 (71%) | $10.59 (78%) | $4.83 (88%) |

At 100% the 24-hour bill spans $4.83 to $32.55 across the band and at 50% $2.31 to $17.79; at
10% and below it never exceeds $3.03, because the free tier swallows the spread.

Caching saves exactly nothing below 10M requests a month, whatever the TTL: the free tier
already covers every read. Its first saving is $0.72 a month at 8% of CTAN, it reaches $6.12 at
20%, and it takes every request the archive serves to reach $38. A one-hour TTL is worthless at
any volume — no object is asked for often enough within one datacentre within one hour — and
the seven objects over Cloudflare's 512 MB cacheable limit miss every time at every TTL.

What turning it on costs is not dollars. A TTL over an hour without purging leaves `/timestamp`
and the directory pages stale for the length of the TTL, which eats most of mirmon's 28-hour
band at 24 hours and exceeds it at a week, so the 48-hour and one-week columns are not
available to an hourly mirror at all. Purging instead means a Cloudflare API token (a sixth
secret), `api.cloudflare.com` (a fifth endpoint) and 30 URLs per call on the Free plan — about
200 calls for the busiest hour of the last year, plus that hour's directory pages — inside the
sync path, to save $0 at the load this mirror sees.

## 4. Monitoring

One healthchecks.io check, pinged once at the end of a successful run. A failed run is the
only alert.

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Schedule | cron `42 * * * *`, timezone UTC, the minute the dispatcher fires |
| Grace | 3 h |
| Pinged by | `ping`, the last task in `sync` |
| Configured by | `HEALTHCHECK_URL`, the check's ping URL, the one optional secret |

The four `AWS_*` secrets are the whole requirement; `HEALTHCHECK_URL` is the fifth and only
optional one. Without it `ping` is skipped and the mirror has no alert at all.

The grace covers a queued run: a dispatch that arrives while a run is going waits for it
(`concurrency`, one pending run per group), and a full `MAX_BATCHES` delta takes up to about
75 minutes, so a ping expected at a given slot may legitimately arrive a good deal after it.
Three hours leaves margin for curl's retries. A genuine stall alerts between 3 h and 4 h 40
min after the last success, which keeps the mirror inside mirmon's 28-hour band with room to
spare.

Cron rather than a simple period: a period check resets its window from the last ping, so
sustained lateness drifts the schedule silently. Cron anchors the expectation to the slot.

Nothing in this repo starts a run, so this check is also the only thing watching the
dispatcher: a scheduler that stops firing looks exactly like a pipeline that stopped
finishing, and both are caught by the same missing ping.

Nothing sends `/start`, so the grace does not cap run duration. Before a first fill or a
large backlog dispatch, pause the check in the UI — a multi-hour run would otherwise blow the
grace. A paused check resumes on its next ping.

The second surface is the run's own job page, where `report` appends the delta, upload,
directory-page, state and storage counts, all read from `RUN/`. It is the first thing to
read on a run that succeeded and still looks wrong. `report` finds the page through
`GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`; if a run's summary turns up in the step log instead, that variable
did not reach the container.

## 5. Runbook

Local commands need the four R2 variables in the environment as `sync.yml` maps them, and
`AWS_CONFIG_FILE=aws.config`.
Every task is safe to rerun unless its entry says otherwise: a second run makes the same
writes with the same bytes, or none.

**Diagnose a failed run.**

```sh
gh run list --workflow sync.yml --limit 5
gh run view <id> --log-failed | tail -50
curl -sI https://ctan.ijosh.com/timestamp | grep -i -E 'last-modified|cf-cache-status'
aws s3 cp s3://ctan/.state/applied.txt.xz - | xz -d | wc -l
```

The failed step names the class. The state's line count against the listing's says how far
behind the mirror is.

**Re-run.** `gh workflow run sync.yml`, or `task sync`. Safe: the state is as of the last
checkpoint and the run recomputes the rest. During a first fill this is the resume.

**The run failed before the pipeline started.** A failure inside `task: [image] docker build`
is the base image pull, not the mirror: Docker Hub was unreachable or throttling. Nothing was
uploaded and no state moved, so re-running is the whole fix. Section 2 has the pull budget.

**Rebuild the state** — a corrupt or distrusted state file. A missing one rebuilds on its
own at the next run.

```sh
gh workflow run sync.yml -f reconcile=true      # or: task sync RECONCILE=true
```

Lists the bucket and joins it to the upstream listing. Same-size objects are taken as
current, so a same-size change that happened while the state was unusable is missed until
upstream touches the file again. Safe: the rebuild uploads nothing. The bucket is the
mirror and the state is a cache of it; losing the state costs one listing, losing the
bucket costs the fill below.

**First fill.** There is no flag. An empty bucket rebuilds to an empty state, the delta is
the whole tree, and each run works `max_batches` batches then queues the next run itself
while batches remain. About 511k Class A and 140 GB from dante, over several chained
runs. Pause the healthcheck first.

**Delete one key.**

```sh
aws s3 rm s3://ctan/<key>
```

Nothing to purge: the edge holds nothing while the cache bypass rule is in place. If
upstream still has the key, the daily reconcile finds it missing and the next hourly run
re-fetches it. Editing the state by hand to get it back sooner is not worth the risk.

**Redraw every directory page.**

```sh
aws s3 rm s3://ctan/.state/indexed.txt.xz
```

The next run finds no record of what the pages show and draws all 27k directories under
both keys, about twenty minutes and 54.5k Class A. Safe; the bucket's files are untouched.
This is also how a change to the page's own markup reaches the pages already in the bucket,
which are otherwise redrawn only when their directory changes.

**A directory URL is a 404.** The page is at its key regardless of the zone:
`curl -sI https://ctan.ijosh.com/systems/knuth/ctan.ijosh.com.directory.index.html`. If that
is 200 and the directory URL is not, the second Transform Rule in section 6 is missing or
mis-scoped.

**Rotate a secret.**

```sh
gh secret set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
gh secret set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
gh workflow run sync.yml && gh run watch
```

Delete the old R2 token in the Cloudflare dashboard after a green run. Safe: the first
call with new credentials is a read.

**Abort a stray multipart upload.**

```sh
aws s3api list-multipart-uploads --bucket ctan --query 'Uploads[].[Key,UploadId,Initiated]' --output text
aws s3api abort-multipart-upload --bucket ctan --key <key> --upload-id <id>
```

Free and safe; R2 does it itself after 7 days.

**dante moved.** Edit `SOURCE` in `Taskfile.yml`, open a PR, merge. Until then every run
spends ten minutes retrying exit 5 and fails, which is the correct loud behaviour.

**The run did not start.** `sync.yml` has one trigger, `workflow_dispatch`, and
[`jshvn/dispatch`](https://github.com/jshvn/dispatch) is what calls it: a Cloudflare Workflow
whose cron `42 * * * *` names this repo's `sync.yml` as a target and POSTs the dispatch with
a GitHub App token.

```sh
gh run list --workflow sync.yml --limit 3       # createdAt against :42
gh workflow view sync.yml                       # "disabled" means a manual stop
```

A run held behind a longer one is normal, and so is a single missing hour — the next
dispatch fetches that hour's delta too. Two consecutive hours with no run: read the
dispatcher's Worker logs, check GitHub's status page for an Actions incident, confirm the
App is still installed here with `actions: write`, and dispatch by hand meanwhile. A hand
dispatch is the same run the dispatcher would have started, and no work is lost by waiting —
only delayed.

## 6. Zone configuration

Set by hand in the Cloudflare dashboard, once. The pipeline makes no Cloudflare API call and
holds no zone credentials: four rules that change roughly never are not worth a subsystem
that can fail. Recorded here so the zone can be rebuilt, or a fork configured, without
rediscovering any of it.

Every rule is scoped to the mirror's hostname. A zone usually serves more than the mirror,
and an unscoped path match reaches all of it.

| Where | Rule | Expression | What to set |
|---|---|---|---|
| Configuration Rules | rewriters and the UA filter off | `(http.host eq "ctan.ijosh.com")` | Email Obfuscation off, Rocket Loader off, Automatic HTTPS Rewrites off, Browser Integrity Check off |
| Cache Rules | cache off | `(http.host eq "ctan.ijosh.com")` | Cache eligibility: bypass cache |
| Transform Rules | `/` serves CTAN's `index.html` | `(http.host eq "ctan.ijosh.com" and http.request.uri.path eq "/")` | Rewrite path to `/index.html` |
| Transform Rules | directory URLs serve the mirror's page | `(http.host eq "ctan.ijosh.com" and ends_with(http.request.uri.path, "/") and http.request.uri.path ne "/")` | Rewrite path, dynamic: `concat(http.request.uri.path, "ctan.ijosh.com.directory.index.html")` |

**The Configuration Rule is the one that matters.** Email Address Obfuscation rewrites every
`text/html` response Cloudflare serves: it injects a script, encodes mailto addresses, and
changes the length. Measured 2026-08-27, a 4,006 byte Catalogue entry was served as 4,216
until the rule went on. About 7,300 files in the tree are HTML, and a mirror that alters
them is not a mirror. Rocket Loader is the same hazard through a second switch.

**Automatic HTTPS Rewrites is a third, and it hides from a size check.** On by default, it
rewrites plain `http://` links in HTML to `https://`. Measured 2026-08-28, about 5% of the
tree's 7,229 HTML files came off the domain with bytes the bucket does not hold — roughly
360 files, `+1` byte per rewritten link. On
`biblio/bibtex/contrib/german/dinat/dinat-index.html` the length did not move at all: the
rewriter lengthened one link by a byte and the HTML parser it runs inside collapsed a
newline within the same tag, so the file measured 7,688 bytes either way and differed at
byte 7,150. That is why `smoke`'s canary compares the object with the response rather than
their lengths, and why the sampled-key size checks alone were never going to find this.

**Browser Integrity Check is the fourth, and it refuses rather than rewrites.** On by
default, it answers `403` (Cloudflare error 1010) to any client whose User-Agent matches
`LWP`, `libwww-perl`, `Python-urllib` or `PycURL`. Measured 2026-08-28 against `ftp.fau.de/ctan`
and `ctan.math.illinois.edu`, which serve all four `200`: no other mirror surveyed rejects
them, so leaving it on makes this the one place the mirror is less capable than the archive
it copies. Browsers, curl, wget, Go, Java and `requests` are unaffected, which is why every
casual check passes. `tlmgr` is unaffected too — TeX Live's `TLDownload.pm` sets
`agent => "texlive/lwp"` explicitly, and its downloader order is `lwp curl wget`, so the
first thing it tries carries a string the filter allows. Verified off for the mirror's
hostname alone on 2026-08-28: `ijosh.com` and `www.ijosh.com` still answer `403` to
`libwww-perl`.

Cloudflare drops `content-length` from `text/html` responses whether or not those features
are on, which is why `smoke` sizes an object from a one-byte ranged read rather than a HEAD.

The other three are conveniences: without the cache rule the zone's default caching applies
(it answers `DYNAMIC` today), without the first transform rule `/` is a 404, and without the
second every other directory URL is.

A rule already in one of those phases that serves another hostname is not ours to replace:
a phase is written whole, so anything else in it would go. Add to it rather than over it.

**If caching is ever wanted**, section 3 has the arithmetic: below 10M requests a month the
free tier covers every read and caching saves nothing, a one-hour TTL is worthless because
Cloudflare caches per datacentre, and a 24-hour TTL first pays at 12M requests a month — six
times what a measured mirror carries — for $0.72. Turning it on also means purging every
changed key after each batch, which the pipeline does not do.

## 7. Why directory pages

Investigated 2026-08-27.

**Nothing on the platform can list a directory except the pipeline.** R2 serves no
directory listings and has no index-document setting; Cloudflare's own docs say a public
bucket's domain does "not let you list the bucket contents at the root of your (sub)
domain," an open feature request for years. The rules engine can't generate one either —
Transform, Redirect, Configuration and Cache rules only rewrite requests and responses that
already exist. Snippets are ruled out on their own limits: 5 ms CPU, 2 MB memory, 32 KB
package, no R2 binding. A Worker with an R2 binding could list a bucket, at the price of a
compute layer in front of a mirror that has none, plus `wrangler` against a repo whose tool
list is fixed.

**CTAN documents listings as a mirror convention, not a requirement.** Its
[instructions for mirror operators](https://ctan.org/mirrors/register/) tell them to set
`Options +Indexes` with `DirectoryIndex disabled`, so the ~111 `index.html` files scattered
through the archive's package directories don't shadow the generated listing. The stated
musts are narrower: HTTPS, rsync from `rsync.dante.ctan.org`, and hourly sync at a fixed
random minute.

**Every other mirror follows the convention.** A survey of all 107 mirrors on
[mirmon](https://ctan.org/mirrors/mirmon), run 2026-08-27, fetched `macros/latex/` from
each: 104 returned a directory listing (Apache autoindex, nginx, Caddy's browse template,
and a few themed or JavaScript indexes), 3 failed to connect, and none redirected elsewhere.
At the archive root most serve CTAN's own `index.html` instead, which is why `/` is
rewritten to it here and no other directory URL is.

**Redirecting to ctan.org instead would take the visitor off the mirror.** CTAN's browse
pages link downloads through `mirrors.ctan.org`, which hands the visitor a randomly chosen
mirror — so a directory URL sent there would cost every download that follows, not only the
listing.

**A directory URL without its trailing slash needs a second key, because no rule can
answer it.** Every other mirror 301s `/systems/knuth` to `/systems/knuth/`; Apache can,
because it knows which names are directories. Measured 2026-08-28, `ftp.fau.de`,
`mirrors.mit.edu`, `ctan.math.illinois.edu` and `mirror.las.iastate.edu` all redirect, and
`mirrors.ctan.org` passes a slashless path straight through to whichever mirror it picks, so
a visitor it sends here would land on a 404. Cloudflare's rules run before the origin and
see only the URL, and the URL does not say which of these is a directory:

    /systems/knuth                                 a directory
    /biblio/biber/base/documentation/Changes       a file

**13,259 upstream files carry no extension** (`README`, `Makefile`, `configure`, `VERSION`,
`Changes`), so a rule appending a slash to every extensionless path would 404 all of them —
worse than the 27,262 it fixed. The mirror image of the heuristic fails too: **212
directories have a dot in their own name** (`biblio/bibtex/utils/bibview-2.0/`,
`documentation/german/stammtisch/wuppertal/stybesch/pk/300/mag____0.790/`). A Worker could
retry the 404 with a slash, but it would sit in front of every request to the mirror, and
Workers Paid at $5/month is more than the whole bucket costs.

So `render` writes each page under both keys, `<dir>/INDEX` and `<dir>`, and the slashless
one answers with the listing rather than a redirect. A key can hold a page or a CTAN file
and never both, because upstream is a filesystem, where a name is a directory or a file.
Three consequences worth keeping in mind:

- **The page carries a `<base href>`.** A relative href on `/systems/knuth` would otherwise
  resolve against `/systems/`. The base makes one document correct under both URLs.
- **The slashless copies stage one tree per depth.** No filesystem holds both `a/b` and
  `a/b/`, which is the same fact that makes the two keys collision-free upstream. Within
  `SLASH/<depth>/` every page is a file with the same number of components, so no page is
  another's parent and each tree uploads whole. Max depth in the tree is 14.
- **The slashless key needs its content type given.** It has no suffix, so the CLI would
  send `binary/octet-stream` and a browser would download the page instead of drawing it.

`reconcile` cannot recognise the second key by name the way it recognises the first, so it
spares every bare directory of the state. A path that stops being a directory upstream
leaves that set and is judged as an ordinary file again.
