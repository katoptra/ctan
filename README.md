An hourly mirror of all of [CTAN](https://ctan.org) on Cloudflare R2, served at
`https://ctan.ijosh.com/` with every CTAN path at the root. About 511,000 files and 140 GB.

## How to use

Your request served to `https://mirrors.ctan.org/` might be redirected to this mirror automatically (once I apply for official mirror status). Until then, the full mirror of CTAN is served from `https://ctan.ijosh.com/`.

TeX Live and TinyTeX both use `tlmgr`:

```sh
tlmgr option repository https://ctan.ijosh.com/systems/texlive/tlnet/
tlmgr update --self --all
```

For a fresh install, give the installer the same URL:

```sh
install-tl -repository https://ctan.ijosh.com/systems/texlive/tlnet/
```

Browse it: any directory URL, `https://ctan.ijosh.com/systems/knuth/`, lists what the
mirror holds there.

To go back to CTAN's mirror rotation: `tlmgr option repository ctan`.

## How it works

On an hourly schedule this GitHub action is triggered and runs the following pipeline.
Every step is a task in [`Taskfile.yml`](https://github.com/katoptra/ctan/blob/main/Taskfile.yml):

1. **`clock` `list` `state` `rebuild`** — stamp the hour, list CTAN's master (dante), and
   fetch the listing the previous run left in the bucket, rebuilding it if it went missing.
2. **`diff` `plan`** — take what upstream has and the state lacks, and split it into batches
   of at most 4 GB. The mirror is never a local copy: the runner has 14 GB, the tree has 140.
3. **`tlpdb` `batches`** — per batch, rsync the files, check the signed TeX Live control
   files against a pinned key fingerprint and every package container against the tlpdb's
   checksums, upload, and write the new state. A run that dies repeats one batch, not all.
4. **`delete` `reconcile`** — drop the keys that left upstream; once a day, sweep the bucket
   against the state for anything neither owns.
5. **`index`** — redraw the directory pages the run changed, since R2 has no listings.
6. **`smoke` `report` `ping`** — read a sample of the run's keys back over the public domain,
   summarise what landed, and ping healthchecks.io. Silence is the alert.

**Is it fresh?**

```sh
curl -s https://ctan.ijosh.com/timestamp
```

## Why use this?

I built this for myself. `mirrors.ctan.org` hands out a different volunteer mirror on every
request, and sooner or later one is overloaded, stale, or unreachable — which breaks the CI
that builds my documents. This is one hostname on
[Cloudflare's network](https://cloudflare.com/network) of 300+ cities, a short and
consistent hop wherever you are. It costs under $2 a month to run: R2 bills for storage and
nothing for bandwidth, so traffic doesn't move the bill.

## Want your own?

1. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/katoptra/ctan) and create an R2 bucket named `ctan` with
   a custom domain pointing at it.
2. Set `HOST` in `Taskfile.yml` to that domain — the only line in the repo that names the
   hostname.
3. Add the four repository secrets below. They are the whole requirement.
4. Actions -> sync -> Run workflow. The first run finds an empty bucket and fills it
   (about 140 GB), `max_batches` at a time, queueing the next run itself until the delta is
   empty; every run after that pushes the hourly delta. Storage past R2's free 10 GB costs
   about $1.95 a month.
5. Uncomment the `schedule:` block in `sync.yml` with a minute per hour to run the sync
   automation.

| Secret | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | R2 API token with Object Read & Write on the bucket |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | That token's secret |
| `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` | `https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` |
| `AWS_REGION` | `auto` |

To test or run locally:

```sh
task run -- task --dry sync
task run -- task sync
```
